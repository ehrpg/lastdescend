_The blacker the sun, the darker the dawn._

# Dark Dawn

The Dark Dawn is a population of humans that life on space ships. They wander
the known systems, without calling any system or planet their home.

# Fleet

The fleet of the Dark Dawn is huge and considerable, and they call one capital
vessel the centre of their fleet. The rest are mostly medium vessels that
support the capital. The capital vessel "Black Sun" is also the main seat of
their leadership, an elected council of elders.

Their main fleet never breaks up, and only rarely do support ships leave the
side of the Black Sun.

# Laws

The Dark Dawn does not recognise or follow the space treaty of 2038, and instead
live by their own rules and laws.

Every prospect of the Dark Dawn is required to contribute to the fleet before
being able to become a member. This applies to their young as much as it applies
to outsiders of the community.

Many of the community's members, and its prospects, revolve to illegal means of
acquiring said contribution. This has lead the Dark Dawn to become feared and
shunned as space pirates, smugglers and traffickers.

Slavery within the community is legal, with many of the non-members being
de-facto slaves and prisoners of the community. Although they have the chance
to buy themselves free, they rarely get the chance to leave to acquire the
contribution necessary to buy themselves free.

# Trade

The Dark Dawn foremost are traders. It doesn't matter if the goods are
considered illegal. The Dark Dawn are also known as slave traders.

Many lone elements of the Dark Dawn are also known to dabble in piracy, and
theft, especially if they still have to make the contribution to the community
before being accepted.

# Feuds

The IPA has classified the Dark Dawn as 'organised crime' and thus openly oppose
the Dark Dawn. While the Dark Dawn avoids any direct confrontations with the
IPA, they have been known to fight skirmishes against the IPA.

Most high ranking or well known members of the Dark Dawn are on a black list of
the IPA, and are thus banned from all IPA run stations and outposts.
