# Organised Crime

## Overview

Most organised crime syndicates that operate on Earth have moved on towards the
space age. This includes most mafias and mobs, such as the Russian Mafia,
Irish Mob, Italian Cosa Nostra, Triads or the Yakuza.

## Crimes

Their crimes include racketeering, black mailing, illegal gambling, smuggling,
human trafficking, and now even space piracy.

Most factions operate chop shops, fronts, outlets and outposts on most of the
stations and planets. Depending on the place, i.e. how much of a presence the
IPA has, it is more easy or difficult to get into contact with these groups.

## Wars

Most wars between the factions have now moved to outer space. Gang and
mafia violence occurs rarely on stations or planets (except on Earth).
