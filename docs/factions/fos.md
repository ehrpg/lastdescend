# F.O.S.

## Overview

F.O.S. (First Order Security) is a new security and private military company
based on Mars. It was founded 2104 to provide security and escort for Martian
businesses and vessels.

## Standards

F.O.S. is known for - and prides itself - for only recruiting the best and also
those with a clean record. They are also known for only working within the
legal framework, and have been known to hand over their own to the IPA in case
of law violations.

The company, and it's executives, is kept in high regard at both the general
public and also within the IPA. Their professional and clean working record,
only attributes to that.

## Recruitment

A clean criminal record and some previous law enforcement work are necessary
to be hired by F.O.S. Most of the mercenaries working for the company, are
former cops or IPA soldiers that wish to earn more in the private sector.

## Force

The security company has built itself a reputation as a "cleaner" yet less
powerful alternative to Fenrir. While F.O.S. sports less personnel and ships,
they rely on quality over quantity.
