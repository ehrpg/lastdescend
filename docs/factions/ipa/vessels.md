# Vessels of the IPA

## Command Carrier

The Command Carrier is currently the largest known vessel (apart from the
unfinished Opus). With a size of over 700 metres, and space to house up to 20000
personnel, and a vast array of weapons it stands as the - as of yet - undefeated
bulwark of the IPA fleet.

Its strengths lie in the massive firepower, large size to soak up vast amounts
of damage and in the ability to effectively coordinate a large armada of
smaller fleet for optimal combat effectiveness. It is also capable of giving
support to smaller fleets, and even launch a vast number of striker craft into
combat.
