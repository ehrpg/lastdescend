# Syndicate

## Overview

The Syndicate is a shadowy crime organisation. Unlike more traditional organised
crime factions, such as the Yakuza, Cosa Nostra or the Mexican Cartels, the
Syndicate allows anyone to be become a member if they proves themselves worthy.

## Secrecy

Members of the syndicate often wear masks to conceal their identity. These masks
are often mechanically enhanced and armoured. Their secrecy even goes so far,
that members often do not know the other members.

Meetings between members are often planned months ahead, and subtle and secret
signs are used to arrange them. Their extensive secrecy, paranoia and an
ever changing communication code have made it possible for them to elude and
evade law enforcement.

## Business

The Syndicate deals in all sorts of illegal businesses: smuggling of drugs,
weapons and other illegal goods such as human trafficking. But it is mainly
known and feared as the main employer of excellent and deadly assassins.

Members of the Syndicate remain mostly anonymous, and rarely operate openly
or in the public. To remain hidden, they also frequently employ third parties
to do their work.

Only those that have - probably unknown to them - proven themselves to the
Syndicate get an invitation to join. The Syndicate also accepts new members
it deems important, wealthy or influential; such as heads of corporations
or influential scientists.

## Infiltration

Members of the syndicate are often accused of secretly infiltrating big
corporations, research stations or other organisations and factions in an
attempt to gain control or steal valuable information or goods.

## Fleet

The Syndicate is not known to operate their own fleet, but rather rely on
third parties, or their own members to add ships to the Syndicates disposal.
