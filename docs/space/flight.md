# Space Flight

## Sublight Engines

Last Descent limits small vessels to sublight engines, which are incredibly
slow. Small vessels are only used to ferry people or cargo within the same
solar system. With the fastest small vessel, a trip from Earth to Mars still
takes fifteen days.

These drives are called Feynman Drives, and are high yield ion thrusters.

## FTL

Medium vessels or above are capable of equipping a Warp drive. The standard
warp drive can achieve speeds of up to 18 parsecs per year. This allows these
crafts to make the trip from Sol to Alpha Centauri (a distance of roughly 1.3
parsecs) in roughly twenty eight days. Faster warp drives exist, but they are
often restricted to large or capital vessels.

Take the vessels FTL speed and multiply it by four. This is the amount of
parsecs per year the FTL drive can achieve.

For example a trip from Sol to Kepler-22 (190 parsecs) would take 10 and a half
years with a craft of a speed of 18 parsecs per year.

### Stasis Chambers

All medium vessels that are fitted with an FTL drive, are also fitted with
cryogenic stasis pods, that allow for long distance flights. A person suspended
in a stasis chamber only requires a minimum amount of fresh air and nutrition,
which is supplied by the chamber. Ageing is effectively halted, so are the
symptoms of most diseases, while being in stasis.

Older and cheaper vessels sport a cryogenic unit. It suspends the person in
a cryogenic sleep. These pods require specific adjustment for the person in
question, and require vast amounts of energy to operate. In case of failure
the person is unfrozen. A person wakes immediately if the pod ceases to
function. If the pod is damaged the person may even take harm from being
unfrozen too quickly, slowly or by being unfrozen partially.

Newer models use a suspension pod. Upon entering the pod, a suspension liquid
is flooded into the chamber. This liquid keeps the person in stasis, and
supplies the person with oxygen and nutrients. The pod requires little power,
and the internal core can last to several months without an external power
supply. However the liquid has to be replaced regularly.

Many stasis pods and chambers can emergency eject in case of disastrous
failure. All pods have an emergency transponder installed. Cryogenic pods
only last for a few days, while suspension pods can last for months, or even
years. After power failure however, the person suspended dies.

## Salvaging

Space debris is often salvaged and reused. Many make their living of salvaging
broken station parts, ships, mining equipment, satellites and other space
debris. Under the law, all ships are required to pick up and transport cryogenic
and suspension pods back to safe harbour. However pirates have been reported to
pickup the pods, mark the inhabitants "dead", and selling them as slaves.
