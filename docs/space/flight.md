# Sublight Engines

Last Descent limits small vessels to sublight engines, which are incredibly
slow. Small vessels are only used to ferry people or cargo within the same
solar system. With the fastest small vessel, a trip from Earth to Mars still
takes fifteen days.

# FTL

Medium vessels or above are capable of equipping a Warp drive. The standard
warp drive can achieve speeds of up to 18 parsecs per year. This allows these
crafts to make the trip from Sol to Alpha Centauri (a distance of roughly 1.3
parsecs) in roughly twenty eight days. Faster warp drives exist, but they are
often restricted to large or capital vessels.

Take the vessels FTL speed and multiply it by two. This is the amount of parsecs
the FTL drive can achieve.

## Stasis Chambers

All medium vessels that are fitted with an FTL drive, are also fitted with
cryogenic stasis pods, that allow for long distance flights. A person suspended
in a stasis chamber only requires a minimum amount of fresh air and nutrition,
which is supplied by the chamber. Ageing is effectively halted, so are the
symptoms of most diseases, while being in stasis.

For example a trip from Sol to Kepler-22 (190 parsecs) would take 10 and a half
years with a craft of a speed of 18 parsecs per year.
