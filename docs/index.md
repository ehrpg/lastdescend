# Last Descent

The Last Descent is a campaign setting for Endless Horizons. It expands the
rules slightly and offers a vast and rich world to set your games in.

## Rule Adaptions

This document describe sthe setting for
[Endless Horizons](https://github.com/ehrpg). It uses the
[rules](https://ehrpg.github.io/rules) mostly unscathed with the following
changes:

- There are no shield generators.
- There is no wormhole drive or wormhole stations.
- There are no subspace FTL drives.

## Theme

Last Descent was built as a low sci-fi setting, where advanced technology does
exist but is rare and expensive. Humanity as colonised the solar system, and
is now pushing for new frontiers after the Warp drive was invented. Alien life,
even microbial life, has yet to be found, and engineering and science is pushing
itself to the limit to build stations and colonies on other planets.

## For Game Masters

For this setting you should built your entrance story and encounters within the
Sol system. While exploration of other systems is possible, it is drastically
limited as it is not possible to refuel outside of known stations or colonies.

Access to semi automatic firearms should also be postponed into the mid game.
Fully automatic firearms, or even military grade weapons, should be given out
sparsely as to not break the balance and feel of the game.
