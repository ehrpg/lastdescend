# Colony

The colony of Kepler 22b is officially administered by a subsidiary of the
United Nations of Earth, and the IPA is responsible for policing the colony.

Currently roughly 32 000 people live and work in Kepler 22b, with numbers
steadily increasing.

Being the most modern and newest colony, the central building is capable of
housing all people living on the planet. It is a multi-level building, with
manufacturing and processing at the lowest levels, trade and commerce at the
middle levels and research and governmental offices at the highest levels.

# Trade

Recently the colony was given clearance to trade filtered water from its oceans
with other colonies and stations. While the colony is itself still funded by
the United Nations of Earth, the colony depends on other goods and services
delivered by stations. Such as luxury and commodity items.

# Policies

Since the oceans are filled with microbial life, visiting the planets surface
is prohibited to avoid contamination. The colony itself is for authorised
personnel only, and visitors are only allowed by admission of the IPA.

# Government

The colony is run by the KRACE - the Kepler Research and Colonisation
Enterprise - a private subsidiary of the United Nations of Earth. The CEO of
KRACE - Dr. Johann Ivanic - oversees the overall direction of the research
being conducted, while the CTO - Dr. Miranda Lerage - oversees the progress
of the colony. They are aided by Admiral Tamamoto Nagasaki of the IPA, who is
in charge of Kepler's security. All the laws imposed by the IPA also apply to
the colony.
