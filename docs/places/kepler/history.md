# Discovery

Kepler-22b was discovered in 2015 by the Hubble Telescope and declared a planet
within the habitable zone of its host star. Whether it was actually habitable
for human life could not be determined before a mission in 2070 was sent out to
survey the planet.

# Survey Mission

The survey mission left in 2070, however with the drives back then it took them
one year to reach the planet, and another to return with the samples. After it
was established that Kepler 22b is the first planet where humans can survive on
the surface, another manned mission was planned.

The goal of the second mission - launched in 2076 - was to determine whether
living on Mars 22b would pose risks, before a colony could be established
there. The project ran successfully for four years before it was decided to
build a colony Kepler 22b.

# Colonisation

Earth began working on a manned colony vessel - which would be used as as the
first colony building in 2082. The separation of Mars in 2083 caused the project
to be halted until 2090 when Mars itself agreed to join the projects. Its
excellent scientists and engineers already well versed in space colonisation
caused the project to be finished before schedule in 2106. The ship was launched
and the planet Kepler 22b was declared officially colonised by 2108.
