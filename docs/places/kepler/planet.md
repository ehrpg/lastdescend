# Atmosphere

The planet Kepler-22b has a human breathable atmosphere, with an air composition
similar to that of Earth. Atmospheric pressure at sea level is slightly lighter
than that on Earth mean sea level. The difference is too minuscule however to
have any noticeable effect.

Temperatures range between -30 degrees Celsius and +25 degrees Celsius during
the day at the equator. The poles are far colder with average temperatures
reaching as low as -50 degrees Celsius.

Sun: 190 parsecs from earth, G5 Type main sequence star, smaller and
cooler than the sun

Planet: Twice the size of earth, 124 earth masses, 290 days per year

# Solar Radiation

The planet still has a functioning magneto sphere and is thus protected from
the solar winds and radiation of its host star Kepler 22.

# Gravity

Gravity on Kepler-22b is slightly higher than on Earth, with roughly 1.2 of
Earth's gravity. The effects of the higher gravity are minuscule, and all
humans used to Earth's gravity can life on the planet without issues.

# Ocean Planet

Kepler-22b is a water planet, with most of its surfaces covered with vast
oceans. The few land masses are devout of life, and are covered deserts of
rock and sand. The oceans are filled with microbiological life however.
