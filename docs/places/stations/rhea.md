The station on Saturn's moon Rhea is one of the newest and most modern mining
stations of Sol. It is owned by the United Nations of Earth, and extracts
minerals, such as copper, iron and nickle for use in ship building.

# History

It's construction started 2093 and was finished by 2098. It is governed by
the IPA, which also manages Rhea Station's security. It has been steadily
expanded since it started production.

# Government

The station is run by the IPA Captain Zheng Shi. The station follows military
style ranks and hierarchy, with all civilians being considered below the rank
of private. Failure to follow orders by a superior IPA officer can be punished
by fine, prison or even a ban from the station.

It is open to civilian visitors, and it can house up to 600 000 people. Many
international trading corporations have an office or outlet on Rhea Station.

Rhea Station itself is considered crime free, with little or no black market
activity, such as smuggling or trafficking.
