# Ganymede Station

## Overview

Ganymede Station is a privately owned station orbiting the moon Ganymede,
where many large corporations own a share of it. It is mainly used as a
trading hub, refuelling station.

## Operation

The station is officially owned by a conglomerate Ganymede Operations Inc.,
in which many companies hold stakes and shares. Security is provided by Fenrir,
which is also the biggest contract for the security firm. The station is led
by a board of directors, and a chief security officer that oversees the
security forces of Fenrir.

Fenrir security has been known to be corrupt on Ganymede station. They are
especially protective of their own, even if they are wanted by the IPA or
other outlets.

## Trading

Ganymede is known as a trading hub, where one can buy everything and anything
available. It has high-class luxury modules where the rich go to shop, party
and do business amongst each other. It also has a shadier side, with criminals
offering and selling anything for the right price.

Another huge income is the ship building business. Many private and small time
mechanics make Ganymede their home to offer ship repairs, modifications and
adjustments. Many come here to legally repair or upgrade their ships to the
latest models, but many also come here to seek illegal upgrades, weapons and
smuggling equipment.

## Mining

The station also mines Ganymede for valuable riches, but recently the mining
has become too dangerous to be profitable.
