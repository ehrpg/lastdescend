# Ceres

## History

Ceres Station, the largest civilian space station in the solar system, houses
1.2 million people. It was established 2071 and was the first successfull
bigger space station to be built and deployed in space.

In 2080 a decree was issued by Earth to reduce the population of Ceres station
from 1 million down to 500 000. Aging station technology and a business deficit
were given as the reason for this move. The Government of Ceres was initially
hesitant to relocate the people, and dragged the execution of the decree out
by bureaucratic means. In late 2080 Earth, after several threats, then lowered
the water the station receives in a move to force people off the station. This
backfired however, as the civilian populace of Ceres rioted. After initial
attempts to quench the riots with force the United Nation came under heavy
criticism. After prolonged demonstration and riots both on Ceres station and
on Earth in support of Ceres, the United Nations nullified the decree and
granted Ceres station semi-independence.

## Government

The station is government by Earth but has achieved semi independence from Earth
after civilian riots broke out during the 2080 population decree fiasco.
lowered significantly. The people did not wish to leave however, and the
Governor of Ceres Station - Elisabeth Avroy - renegotiated with Earth.

The elected governor of Ceres station can now enact local laws, and has its
own police force to enforce those laws. While the IPA still provides external
security to the ships docking at Ceres station.

## Economy

Ceres Station lives of mining Ceres for minerals and water, which it then
trades with other stations, Earth and Mars.

After the riots of 2080 the station got into social disarray, and criminal
elements took hold. Various pirate factions, and other organised crime
organisation front businesses on Ceres station to conclude their illegal
deals.
