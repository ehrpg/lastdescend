Ceres Station, the largest civilian space station in the solar system, houses
1.2 million people. It was established 2071 and was the first successfull
bigger space station to be built and deployed in space.

The station is government by Earth but has achieved semi independence from Earth
after civilian riots broke out during the 2080 water shortage on the station.
Earth refused to send more water to the station, because the station was running
a massive deficit; and instead ordered the population of Ceres station to be
lowered significantly. The people did not wish to leave however, and the
Governor of Ceres Station - Elisabeth Avroy - renegotiated with Earth.

Ceres Station lives of mining Ceres for minerals and water, which it then
trades with other stations and Mars.

After the riots of 2080 the station got into social disarray, and criminal
elements took hold. Various pirate factions, and other organised crime
organisation front businesses on Ceres station to conclude their illegal
deals.
