# Opus Station

## Overview

Construction of Opus station started in 2108 by the FMR, and is the first big
research and engineering project of the Martian Republic. It is being
constructed inside the Gliese 667C System roughly 23 light years from Sol.

## Scope

The station is planned to be a massive space ship, and, according to the plans,
is slated to be finished in 2128. It will house roughly 250 000 people, and
will have a warp drive to jump to different systems.

The intent was to create a wandering station that can take advantage of
resources within a system and then move on if need to.

## Construction

At the moment the station is only partially open to the public for official
business regarding the construction. The FMR oversees the construction and
security of the project without having the IPA involved.

Although the station is not open to the public, it does have a market, pubs
and all other accommodations necessary to entertain visitors and workers alike.

## Security

Security on board the station is provided by F.O.S. a smaller security firm
based on Mars.
