The First Martian Republic (often shortened to just Mars or the Republic) owns
and spans the entire colony of Mars. With the A central space station,
Mars Prime, initially built by ESA serves as the capital.  Underground
rail systems connect the other space stations together.

By 2112 roughly 40 million people call the FMR their home, with an additional
five million people visiting the FMR yearly.

The FMR is congressional republic, headed by a largely representative president.

# Cities

The FMR consists of six cities (or hubs) that were based upon the initial
space stations landed onto Mars. The stations are all tubular, and split into
different highly specialised sections. For example every city has an
agricultural section, various interconnected tubular stations and ports
responsible for growing and processing food. Other sections are responsible
for civilian housing, mining the Martian crust, or housing research
laboratories.

None of the six cities are specialised in one area, and each is theoretically
capable of sustaining itself. At the centre of hubs lies the biggest: Mars Prime
which houses roughly 10 million people.

The six cities are: Mars Prime, Phobos, Deimos, Dawn, Yinghuo and Mangalyaan.
All of these are connected through underground rail systems.

## Zond Incident

A seventh city, Zond was destroyed in 2093 by asteroid impacts, which damaged
their stations hull venting their atmosphere. The incident killed 1.4 million
people. The underground railway to Zond was destroyed by secondary explosions,
causing the inhabitants of Zond to be trapped on the destroyed station.

Overland craft from Zond and Dawn (the nearest hub) managed to evacuate twenty
thousand people before the station was effectively destroyed by secondary
explosions.

# Laws & Society

The FMR bans all civilian fire arm use, and heavily limits their use within
Martian Police Forces (MPF) so as not to damage the space station, or even
risk a breach of the hull.

All visitors of the FMR are restricted to the hub they have business in, while
citizens of the FMR can travel freely; but must have a move from one city to
another approved by the authorities.

Citizens of the FMR are required to do a mandatory six year community service,
to aid and benefit the colony and its advance. Boys and girls are drafted after
school at the age of 16, after their six year community service they are free to
choose were to live and work. Community service ranges wildly, and can also
include military service. The community service is also required for everyone
who wishes to become a citizen of Mars. Aborting the community service can cause
one to lose his Martian citizenship.

The First Martian Republic has a strong incentive system in place however, which
results in the FMR having one of the lowest expat rate in the solar system.

Citizens of the Martian Republic enjoy liberal rights, while the economy is more
closely regulated towards the growth of the colony.

# Foreign Relations

While the FMR officially holds good relationships with Earth, many people from
Earth see the people and citizens of Mars as blended ideologists with an
unreachable goal: terra forming Mars.

Many from Earth also still believe that the FMR owes them, for their space
programs that effectively gave birth to the FMR in the first place. However,
with the independence treaty of 2083 the FMR was officially absolved from
such claims.

# Space Station OSIRIS

The FMR also runs and operaters a large [space station](/places/mars/osiris)
in orbit around Mars.

# Terraforming

While it is currently not yet possible to terra form planets, the FMR invests
heavily into that research. The goal is to one day make the surface of the
planet liveable. Many scholars and researchers believe this to be impossible
however, as Mars lacks a magnetic field that would protect an atmosphere from
being blasted away by solar radiation.

# Role in the IPA

The First Martian Republic, alongside with the Earths United Nations, is one
of main contributor to the Inter-Planetary Authority.

Mars is known as a builder of high quality and high tech space vessels, and the
main bulk of the IPA fleet is built on Mars.
