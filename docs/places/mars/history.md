In 2053, after the Feynman drive allowed for easier space travel within the
solar system, ESA and NASA established a science and research station on Mars.
Other countries and space nations followed suit, and built their own stations
on Mars.

With the advent of the Warp drive in 2062 the space stations grew ever bigger,
as it was far easier now to transport people, material and resources from and
two Mars. Over the decades that followed the space stations, merged to form
one gigantic space station.

On the 10th of June in 2083 the Martian space station, now housing roughly 8
million people declared independence as the First Martian Republic (FMR). Two
months later, after negotiations with the United Nations the FMR was formerly
established.
