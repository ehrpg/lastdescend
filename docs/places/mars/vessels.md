# Vessels of the FMR

## TAN-4

The TAN-4 is the default fighter/bomber of the FMR. It is considered the most
modern of its type. It is primarily used to defend OSIRIS and the martian
cities from threats. The IPA also uses it as its mainstay striker craft.

It's ingenuity in design gives it superior speed and manoeuvrability, in both
air and space environments.

## MF-12

The MF-12 is the standard martian shuttle that flies between the Martian
Republic and its space station. It was built to fly cargo and people between
the Martian Republic and the space station of OSIRIS. It seats 50 people and
has a crew of two: a pilot and a copilot. Transport MF-12 also exist, which
can carry up to 80 metric tons.

They are also sometimes used to make direct trade runs between Mars and other
stations.

From the perspective of its design the MF-12 was highly inspired by the Baleen
RP-2.
