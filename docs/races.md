# Humans

Humans are - apart from robots - the most prevalent race in the Last Descent.
Just like the humans on earth, they come from a wide variety of backgrounds,
cultures and professions.

## Space Born

Many are born and live in the weightlessness of space. These are generally
called _space born_. The bodies of space born humans lack the required strength
to move and live on celestial bodies with high gravity. People born on space
stations and space ships also have a knack for fixing things mechanically.

- -1 Strength
- Micro Gravity: 3
- Mechanics: 2
- Flaw: Weak Physique

_Weak Physique (Flaw)_: Requires twice as many movement points on Planets with
gravity greater then half of Earth's.

## Earth Born

The richest, or the luckiest, are born on Earth or an Earth like planet. Their
bodies evolve naturally compared to their space born brethren. Planet born have
no intrinsic penalties or bonuses.

- Flaw: Space Adaption Syndrome

_Space Adaption Syndrome (Flaw)_: Earth born humans that are exposed to micro
gravity for a long time (three months or more), suffer from
_space adaption syndrome_, which gradually gets worse. A first the person
suffers a -1 penalty against all checks involving sickness or illness. Then
their bones lose mass and after five months they lose one strength rank, and
then after another month they lose one perception rank as their eyesight gets
worse. These penalties can be removed by an extended stay (2 weeks) on a planet
or station with Earth like gravity.

# Robots

Robots are simple, non-sentient droids deployed for manual labour. They are
capable of accepting simple commands and usually work - instead of humans - in
dangerous or hazardous environments. Robots come in as many shapes as there are
jobs and functions that require them.

High grade corporations, militaries also deploy combat robots equipped with
various weapons.

Almost all robots either use two legs or tracks to move about, and may be
equipped with additional
