# Dangers of Space

Space is a scary place, and there is often just a thin layer of metal between
you and certain death. A character with this perk is more calm in dangerous
environments or situations that occour in space.

A character with this perk has any penalty because of a hazardous space
environment reduced by one.

Additionally a character with this perk only suffers half the morale damage, in
case of failures, catastrophes or problems that arise in the vacuum of space.
