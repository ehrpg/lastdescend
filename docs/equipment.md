## Permits

Permits and forms allow characters to carry around, purchase, or operate certain
items.

### Vessel Permits

Permit 12a allows the vessel to be armed with all weapons. Point defence are
allowed even without a 12a. Nuclear missiles are only allowed with a 12b which
is usually not obtainable. It is sufficient if one the crew has this licence.

### Personal permits

Personal permits allow a character to wield, purchase and carry certain items.
Owning of a semi automatic hand gun is legal, but only 22a gives the permit
to carry them on space stations or on planets. Owning of semi automatic high
calibre weapons (rifles, shotguns, PDWs) is generally forbidden for civilians.

weapons.

Most of these licences can be temporarily or permanently suspended or revoked
by authorities.
