## Drugs

Drugs can be consumed to gain a temporary benefit, yet are highly addictive.
The first table lists all drugs that have a benefit upon consumption, and the
second table lists other drugs that are mainly traded and dealt to addicts.
After effects kick in when the main effect end. The effects of drugs do not
stack with each other, and taking different or the same drug multiple times only
add more after effects. Prices are for one dose.

| Name       | Description    | Effects   |  After Effects  | Cost
|------------|----------------|-----------|----------|---------
| Speed      | -              | +1 Perception for 6 hours, stops tiredness | -  | 600
| Red Eye  | Highly specialised combat drug | +1 Per and +1 Dex for 4 hours | Tiredness, exhausted and 1 HP lost | 1200
| Blood Eye | Improved Red Eye | +2 Per and +2 Dex for 4 hours | Tiredness, exhaustion, addiction and 1d4 HP lost | 2500
| Saat      | Used in doping   | +1 STR and +1 CON for 8 hours | Highly addictive,
-1 Dex and -1 Int for 24 hours | 1500

Red Eye and Blood Eye come in small vials and is sprayed into the eye. One vial
has five usages before being empty. Consuming the entire vile in one go, results
in a deadly overdose.

Saat is a pill and is often eaten, or made into a powder and drunk.

## Healing Equipment

Wound gel is put over open wounds to stop bleeding and avoid infection. A
doctor can still easily remove it and then tend to the wounds. Wound foam is
used on open and with internal wounds and stops internal bleeding. It is used
in combat to temporarily stabilise the patient until they can reach a medical
doctor. It lasts for 24 hours, after which the patient begins to lose HP and
accumulate wounds as normal.

An adrenaline shot (or combat shot) allows a character to "ignore" 2d4 HP for
the next six hours. Adrenaline and combat shot are addictive, and extended use
might result in a dependency.

## Reconstructive Surgery

Artificial limbs are robotic limbs that range from heavy and clumsy, to almost
perfect. Cloned limbs are created from the DNA and stem cells of the actual
host and take weeks or even months to finish (depending on the size). Cloned
limbs are the more expensive (but more authentic) alternative to artificial
limbs.

Artificial limbs cannot be detached from the body.  They are directly crafted
onto nerves and skin, and replacing them means another surgery to remove the
old and reattach the new limb.

## Permits

Permits and forms allow characters to carry around, purchase, or operate certain
items.

### Vessel Permits

Permit 12a allows the vessel to be armed with all weapons. Point defence are
allowed even without a 12a. Nuclear missiles are only allowed with a 12b which
is usually not obtainable. It is sufficient if one the crew has this licence.

| Name       | Description | Cost
|------------|-------------|-------
| Permit 12a | Allows a space vessel to be equipped with weapons. | 500000
| Permit 12b | Allows carrying of nuclear weapons | Can't be bought

### Personal permits

Personal permits allow a character to wield, purchase and carry certain items.
Owning of a semi automatic hand gun is legal, but only 22a gives the permit
to carry them on space stations or on planets. Owning of semi automatic high
calibre weapons (rifles, shotguns, PDWs) is generally forbidden for civilians.

Most of the weapon licences also allow the purchasing of ammunition for these
weapons.

Most of these licences can be temporarily or permanently suspended or revoked
by authorities.
