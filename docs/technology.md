## UPID

The Unique Person ID, or UPID, identifies a person across all stations and
networks. It registers information about said person, and can be read by all
station security devices.

All personal things are associated with this UPID, such as permits, forms,
citizenship, ownership certificates, bans, bounties, and so forth.

In older times the UPID was a physical pass, a small plastic card, not unlike
a credit card. Newer models are directly embedded into the body so they cannot
be stolen that easily.

As with everything, a lucrative illegal business sprung up that deals in the
manipulation, removal or swapping of such UPID chips and passes.

## Credits

Credits in Last Descent is an inter-system currency that is linked 1:1 to the
Euro. Other major currencies are the USD which is also bound to Credit in 1:2
fashion, so 2 USD are one 1 Credit. Credit can be used instead of the local
currency on most stations and nations.

The most common way of paying are cash cards. They are preloaded with a given
amount of value on them, and can be used as a debit card until they are empty.
Credit Cards also exist, and are usually linked with a bank account. Paper
currency still exists as well, but is rarely used anymore except on a few
stations and outposts that do not have a reliable way to process cash cards or
credit cards. The paper currency equivalent of Credits are either Euro or USD.

All PDAs are capable of depositing and removing money from cash and credit
cards. Money rewards, prices and sometimes salaries are often given out in
the form of cash cards.

## PDAs

The PDAs of Endless Horizons are the newest and latest models of smart phones.
They have a big class screen and built using aluminium or other high endurance
metals and polymers. They built so rigid, so they can take some damage while
floating and bumping around in micro gravity.

PDAs are highly valuable, and expensive and are often the targets of thieves.
All PDAs are by default encrypted.

## Energy

With the rise of better battery technology, electricity has taken over mankind's
technology. Electricity is used to power cars, helicopters, almost all
appliances. All aircraft use some sort of high yield Ion Engine.

After the successful completion of ITER in 2028 fusion engines became more and
more widespread.

This has lead the price of fossil fuels (oil, diesel, gas) to drop drastically.
While vehicles with internal combustion engines still exists, they are most
often kept only for recreational purposes.

## Internet

_Never underestimate the bandwidth of a fleet of haulers hurling down the
highway_

The earth's internet hit a barrier in reaching the furthest reaches of space,
namely other star systems.  While the technology was brought to all stations,
ships and planets, they are only interlinked with each other within the same
solar system.

Data is transferred by hauling data storage units by ship from one solar
system to another. A business has formed around this need, were so called data
haulers offer their services in transporting data from one place to
another. Likewise pirates have targeted these haulers, to steal
it. Potentially to find something which incriminates the owners.

On newer models of the sensor array (Sensor Array MK III in any size category)
it is possible to send information across warp, but the information still takes
some time to reach its destination. In warp the radio waves used for
communication travel with a speed of 20 parsecs a year.

Due to this delay, email as resurfaced as the main means of making contact with
another across solar systems.
