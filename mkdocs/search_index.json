It registers information about said person, and can be read by all\nstation security devices.\n\n\nAll personal things are associated with this UPID, such as permits, forms,\ncitizenship, ownership certificates, bans, bounties, and so forth.\n\n\nIn older times the UPID was a physical pass, a small plastic card, not unlike\na credit card. Newer models are directly embedded into the body so they cannot\nbe stolen that easily.\n\n\nAs with everything, a lucrative illegal business sprung up that deals in the\nmanipulation, removal or swapping of such UPID chips and passes.\n\n\nCredits\n\n\nCredits in Last Descent is an inter-system currency that is linked 1:1 to the\nEuro. Other major currencies are the USD which is also bound to Credit in 1:2\nfashion, so 2 USD are one 1 Credit. Credit can be used instead of the local\ncurrency on most stations and nations.\n\n\nThe most common way of paying are cash cards. They are preloaded with a given\namount of value on them, and can be used as a debit card until they are empty.\nCredit Cards also exist, and are usually linked with a bank account. Paper\ncurrency still exists as well, but is rarely used anymore except on a few\nstations and outposts that do not have a reliable way to process cash cards or\ncredit cards. The paper currency equivalent of Credits are either Euro or USD.\n\n\nAll PDAs are capable of depositing and removing money from cash and credit\ncards. Money rewards, prices and sometimes salaries are often given out in\nthe form of cash cards.\n\n\nPDAs\n\n\nThe PDAs of Endless Horizons are the newest and latest models of smart phones.\nThey have a big class screen and built using aluminium or other high endurance\nmetals and polymers. They built so rigid, so they can take some damage while\nfloating and bumping around in micro gravity.\n\n\nPDAs are highly valuable, and expensive and are often the targets of thieves.\nAll PDAs are by default encrypted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nCost\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nHacking DC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDA\n\n\n1000\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity\n\n\nWith the rise of better battery technology, electricity has taken over mankind's\ntechnology. Electricity is used to power cars, helicopters, vessels and almost\nall appliances. All aircraft and vessels use the Feynman Drive, a high yield Ion\nEngine, as their sublight engine.\n\n\nAfter the successful completion of ITER in 2028 fusion engines became more and\nmore widespread. Fusion cores are used, as Power Cores, on all ships and vessels\nfor power.\n\n\nWhile solar power has been improved and is available on most vessels, it only\ngenerates enough electricity to keep basic systems up and running. The core of\na small or medium vessel may be recharged with solar power, but that can take\nup to several months or even years. Nevertheless some pilots have managed to\ngo into stasis while their ships recharge just enough, by using solar power,\nto give them enough velocity to hurl them towards a nearby space station.\n\n\nThis has lead the price of fossil fuels (oil, diesel, gas) to drop drastically.\nWhile vehicles with internal combustion engines still exists, they are most\noften kept only for recreational purposes or because of sentimental value.\n\n\nDeuterium\n\n\nDeuterium, most often shipped and sold in the form of heavy water, is used as\nthe fuel for the fusion cores. The deuterium is refined and sold on all planets\nand stations. Earth is the biggest exporter of deuterium, as it is found\nnaturally in the oceans. Other stations mine asteroids or the subsurface lakes\nof their host planets for deuterium.\n\n\nInternet\n\n\nNever underestimate the bandwidth of a fleet of haulers hurling down the\nhighway\n\n\nThe earth's internet hit a barrier in reaching the furthest reaches of space,\nnamely other star systems.  While the technology was brought to all stations,\nships and planets, they are only interlinked with each other within the same\nsolar system.\n\n\nData is transferred by hauling data storage units by ship from one solar\nsystem to another. A business has formed around this need, were so called data\nhaulers offer their services in transporting data from one place to\nanother. Likewise pirates have targeted these haulers, to steal\nit. Potentially to find something which incriminates the owners.\n\n\nOn newer models of the sensor array (Sensor Array MK III in any size category)\nit is possible to send information across warp, but the information still takes\nsome time to reach its destination. In warp the radio waves used for\ncommunication travel with a speed of 20 parsecs a year.\n\n\nDue to this delay, email as resurfaced as the main means of making contact with\nanother across solar systems.\n\n\nFood\n\n\nFood has largely shifted towards an all vegetarian diet. With the dwindling\nliving space and nature on Earth, and the massive increase in population in\nthe solar system, meat has become expansive. Only the rich can afford meat on\na regular basis, with the moderately rich being able to afford meat once or\ntwice a month. Meat alternatives exist, being made from soy or grown\nartificially in a laboratory.\n\n\nCloning\n\n\nCloning has been perfected over the last decades. It became cheap enough to be\nheavily used on live stock. Cloning humans however is strictly forbidden, with\nthe cloning of human body parts (for emergencies) being the only exception. The\nonly thing that cannot be successfully cloned (or at least not without many\nfailures and set backs) is the human brain.\n\n\nReconstructive Surgery\n\n\nWhile cloning human body parts (for reconstructive surgery) is possible and\nallowed, it is tremendously expensive. A reconstructed human hand costs\nbetween 9 and 15 million credits. An entire arm 25 million credits and\nabove. Organs also cost between 5 and 10 million credits. This cloning process\nis not error free, and if complications arise the price also rises. Everything,\nexcept for the brain, can be cloned however. This also includes muscles and\nskin, for example to repair burnt or otherwise scarred tissue or body parts.\n\n\nAttaching a cloned limb is usually done by the company that created it, but\nthe surgery DC is 15 and the operation usually takes 4 hours.\n\n\nThe cheaper alternative are artificial limbs, created with advanced robotics.\nDepending on the price and the model these limbs range from clumsy and heavy,\nto almost perfect. All doctors are trained in attaching these limbs, and most\nmechanics are capable of servicing them in case they get damaged.\n\n\nArtificial limbs behave just like normal limbs (they can be targeted, shot and\ndamaged) but may incur additional penalties or bonuses. While they require\npower to function, it is usually too much hassle to track this rules wise.\nTheir weight however, gets added normally to the carrying weight of the\ncharacter. Attaching an artificial limb is a surgery check DC 10 and takes\nroughly 2 hours.\n\n\nRobots and Droids\n\n\nRobotics has made a major leap forward in the past century. Robots exist in\nvarious shapes, forms and sizes and are used extensively for manual labour.\nRobots can now walk on two legs reliably, take simple orders and communicate\nin simple terms verbally. They are far from being sentient however, and can\nnot be used for more complex tasks. Almost all robots can also be used remotely,\nfor example to repair hull damage without actually leaving the ship or douse\nflames without having to expose oneself to heat and toxic gases. Robots come\nin as many shapes as the tasks they have to perform. From heavy tracked\nautomated land moves, to small and agile welding robots.\n\n\nArmed security robots do exist, and are heavily used by corporations and other\nprivate ventures. They are armed, heavily armoured, and often follow and\nenforce a strict protocol.\n\n\nDroids are simply robots that have been built to mimic a human, and are often\nused in roles where they come in contact with humans. For example, most stations\nand planetary stations use droids as tourist guides. Droids are also used as\nhouse hold robots, where they might have to welcome guests.",

It was colloquially named after the FTL drive in \nStar\nTrek\n franchise: Warp.\n\n\nIn the aftermath of this huge breakthrough for the human race, the European\nUnion and its trade partners in Asia created the European and Asian Coalition.\nTogether they signed the Treaty of Moscow, to advance the human race towards\nthe final frontier.\n\n\nThe government form of the EAC has been unchanged from its precursor the\nEuropean Union, and the new countries have simply been 'added' as new members\nof the EAC.\n\n\nUnited Americas\n\n\nThe United Americas consists of all of the nations of the northern as well as\nthe southern Americas. After the trade deals between Europe and Asia, the USA\nsought closer ties to its neighbours and solidified their trade and political\ndeals under the banner of the United Americas.\n\n\nWhile the United Americas have been surpassed as the de-facto superpower of\nEarth by the EAC, they still house some of the most important research\norganisations, corporations and sport together one of the largest economies of\nEarth.\n\n\nIn 2043 the DARPA, together with subcontractors and various research institutes\ndeveloped the Feynman Drive, a new sublight engine that works by only requiring\nelectrical power as fuel. Together with the fusion cores researched at ITER,\nthis allowed NASA and ESA to undertake more advanced space missions. The Feynman\nDrive is still in use on all space vessels.\n\n\nAfrican Union\n\n\nThe African Union achieved economical and societal stability in the early\n21st century.

Trade agreements with Japan, China, a newly united Korea,\nAustralia and other nations of Asia catapulted the European Union towards the\nfront of research, space exploration, living standards, social development and\ncorporate cooperation.  This deal bore fruit in 2062 as the just recently merged Zeiss and Yahari\ncorporations (now under the name SART) created the first viaable faster than\nlight space drive. It was colloquially named after the FTL drive in  Star\nTrek  franchise: Warp.  In the aftermath of this huge breakthrough for the human race, the European\nUnion and its trade partners in Asia created the European and Asian Coalition.\nTogether they signed the Treaty of Moscow, to advance the human race towards\nthe final frontier.  The government form of the EAC has been unchanged from its precursor the\nEuropean Union, and the new countries have simply been 'added' as new members\nof the EAC.",
